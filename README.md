# Flight_delays

This project is based on the kaggle competition hosted by OpenDataScience ML course (https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-fall-2018/overview). It includes bits and pieces of EDA and feature engineering. I was mainly focused on creating and getting used to working with gradient boosting framework models (the CatBoost and the LightGBM). It was very intresting to optimize hyperparameters of these models using differen techniques. 

The next step for me would be to dive deeper into the structure of these models to be able to interpret all of the parameters and optimize their values more efficiently.
